I am developing a small web application project focused on user management dashboard. I will work on the front-end using React.js by executing the following command: npx create-react-app dashboard-app.

Next, I will install the necessary packages by running npm install.

To run my web application, follow these steps:

For the dashboard-app:

Navigate to the dashboard-app folder: cd dashboard-app
Install the required packages: npm install
Start the front-end application: npm start
